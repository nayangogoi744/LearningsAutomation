This is to show case why we need @AfterMethod
eg ; For hardAssert if the assertion fails the execution will stop at that position. Rest of the code will be uncovered
So if you have a code which will close the browser , it will not be executed. Hence your browser will stay open.
In this condition if you put @AfterMethod with proper close tag, it will execute after each Test and close the browser.
